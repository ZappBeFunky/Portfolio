                                Going to the cinema is a fun experience, but
                                ordering the tickets in many apps and website
                                often feels like navigation in a really long and
                                frustrating process.

                            <h1>Today’s Solution</h1>

                            <p>
                                After going through different cinema websites, I
                                saw major UX problems in many of them. I chose
                                to focus on the experience in one of the biggest
                                cinema companies in my country, Cinema City —
                                www.cinemacity.co.il, as a basis for the problem
                                I wanted to fix. I downloaded and installed
                                their iOS app to see how it works today.
                            </p>

                                In order to build realistic user stories, I
                                surveyed 10 people, aged between 22 to 32, who
                                go to the cinema at least once every two months.
                                The questions focused about the last time they
                                went to the cinema. Main takeaways:
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Six said they wanted to watch a specific movie,
                                so they were looking for the right time to see
                                it.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Two said they wanted to go to the cinema at a
                                specific time of the week, so they were looking
                                for the best movie available at that time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                One said she wanted to go to the cinema during
                                some evening this week.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                All of them wanted to go to a movie around their
                                living / working area.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After making a few assumptions myself, I joined
                                it with some more questions I asked in the
                                survey to support / contradict my assumptions
                                with data, and help me find the major and minor
                                pain points.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The current app does not support any of the user
                                stories really well. It forces the user to give
                                all the exact details (specific movie, specific
                                theater, specific date, specific hour) before
                                seeing if the screening is available / not
                                available.
                            </p>

                            <p>6/10 complained that the process feels long.</p>

                            <p>
                                4/10 complained about not having seats after
                                going through the entire process during busy
                                evenings.
                            </p>

                                2/10 Complained about having to pay extra fees
                                they didn’t expect.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Other complaints mentioned the app’s low speed
                                or bugs.

                                The solution takes two of the main user stories
                                into account. I split the options to either
                                Search by Movie or Search by Time. I tried to
                                offer relevant screenings at each stage of the
                                process, with extra choices functioning as a
                                smart filter option.

                                stories
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The two main user stories are people who are
                                looking for a good time to watch the new Justice
                                League movie (not too bad, by the way), and
                                people who are looking for a nice movie to watch
                                during Wednesday afternoon. These are just
                                specific examples, but they help understand what
                                does the user expect to see.

                                This information made it easy to make the choice
                                of splitting the browsing functioning, to
                                ‘Search by Title’ and ‘Search by Time’. Doing
                                this, made the UI for both simpler and easier to
                                navigate.

                                When searching for a good movie to watch at a
                                specific time, having a date picker is not
                                really needed, since the tickets are only sold
                                for the following week (true to the example
                                website I chose), and updated every day.
                                Choosing the exact time is not really needed at
                                this stage. The user’s task is to choose a movie
                                and a day / time of day. I chose to spread all
                                the choices using big buttons that will be
                                easily understandable to everybody, and hard to
                                miss. Every choice filters the available movies,
                                and highlights the relevant screen times.

                                According to the survey, some of the
                                frustrations come from the fact that they
                                finally choose the right screening time + movie
                                for them, only to realize there are no relevant
                                available seats. I solved it by helping them
                                make the right choice. Next to each screening
                                (that will open a ‘choose seats’ dialog followed
                                by payment and producing the ticket), I will
                                show an icon hinting how many seats are
                                available.

                            <h1>Payment</h1>

                            <p>
                                I chose to show the payment once the user
                                selects the seats. The price should be
                                transparent and shown upfront, so there won’t be
                                any surprises.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I didn’t want to reinvent the checkout process,
                                I believe this problem can be best solved by
                                Apple Pay or Google Wallet. In the real app,
                                there would need to be more traditional choices
                                for payment.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                I also chose to add illustrations of tickets, to
                                make it feel like the reward (the movie tickets)
                                is just behind this next button. This, I
                                believe, would make the process feel more
                                rewarding.

                                    I wanted to run a small experience to see if
                                    my solution works well. So I used these
                                    screens and built a prototype in InVision
                                    for the app. I shared it with 3 friends
                                    who’ve never seen the app. I told them to:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Try to buy 2 tickets to ‘Blade Runner 2049',
                                    today, to the screening with the least seats
                                    taken.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Once you’re done, buy 2 tickets to any movie
                                    today in the evening.
                                </p>

                            They were successful doing that, but it still
                            doesn’t mean much :) It only means that it’s not too
                            complicated. This is an MVP tested on very few
                            people, and in the real world there are many more
                            things to consider and monitor.

                        <p>
                            If Cinema companies had more awareness to user
                            experience, I’m sure more people would want to go to
                            the cinemas. Maybe with this change, next time a new
                            cool indie movie comes out, I might actually find
                            someone who’d like to join me.
