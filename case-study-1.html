                        Going to the cinema is a fun experience, but ordering
                        the tickets in many apps and website often feels like
                        navigation in a really long and frustrating process.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Today’s Solution</h1>

                    <p>
                        After going through different cinema websites, I saw
                        major UX problems in many of them. I chose to focus on
                        the experience in one of the biggest cinema companies in
                        my country, Cinema City — www.cinemacity.co.il, as a
                        basis for the problem I wanted to fix. I downloaded and
                        installed their iOS app to see how it works today.
                    </p>

                <section class="project-info">
                    <h1>User Stories</h1>

                    <p>
                        In order to build realistic user stories, I surveyed 10
                        people, aged between 22 to 32, who go to the cinema at
                        least once every two months. The questions focused about
                        the last time they went to the cinema. Main takeaways:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Six said they wanted to watch a specific movie, so they
                        were looking for the right time to see it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Two said they wanted to go to the cinema at a specific
                        time of the week, so they were looking for the best
                        movie available at that time.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        One said she wanted to go to the cinema during some
                        evening this week.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        All of them wanted to go to a movie around their living
                        / working area.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Pain Points</h1>

                    <p>
                        After making a few assumptions myself, I joined it with
                        some more questions I asked in the survey to support /
                        contradict my assumptions with data, and help me find
                        the major and minor pain points.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The current app does not support any of the user stories
                        really well. It forces the user to give all the exact
                        details (specific movie, specific theater, specific
                        date, specific hour) before seeing if the screening is
                        available / not available.
                    </p>

                    <p>6/10 complained that the process feels long.</p>

                    <p>
                        4/10 complained about not having seats after going
                        through the entire process during busy evenings.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        2/10 Complained about having to pay extra fees they
                        didn’t expect.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Other complaints mentioned the app’s low speed or bugs.

                <section class="project-info">
                    <h1>Suggested Solution</h1>

                    <p>
                        The solution takes two of the main user stories into
                        account. I split the options to either Search by Movie
                        or Search by Time. I tried to offer relevant screenings
                        at each stage of the process, with extra choices
                        functioning as a smart filter option.
                    </p>

                <section class="project-info">
                    <h1>Suggested Solution</h1>

                    <p>1. Differentiation between the different user stories</p>
                    <p>
                        The two main user stories are people who are looking for
                        a good time to watch the new Justice League movie (not
                        too bad, by the way), and people who are looking for a
                        nice movie to watch during Wednesday afternoon. These
                        are just specific examples, but they help understand
                        what does the user expect to see.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This information made it easy to make the choice of
                        splitting the browsing functioning, to ‘Search by Title’
                        and ‘Search by Time’. Doing this, made the UI for both
                        simpler and easier to navigate.

                    <h1>2. Simplification of fields</h1>
                    <p>
                        When searching for a good movie to watch at a specific
                        time, having a date picker is not really needed, since
                        the tickets are only sold for the following week (true
                        to the example website I chose), and updated every day.
                        Choosing the exact time is not really needed at this
                        stage. The user’s task is to choose a movie and a day /
                        time of day. I chose to spread all the choices using big
                        buttons that will be easily understandable to everybody,
                        and hard to miss. Every choice filters the available
                        movies, and highlights the relevant screen times.

                    <h1>3. Helping the user make better choices</h1>
                    <p>
                        According to the survey, some of the frustrations come
                        from the fact that they finally choose the right
                        screening time + movie for them, only to realize there
                        are no relevant available seats. I solved it by helping
                        them make the right choice. Next to each screening (that
                        will open a ‘choose seats’ dialog followed by payment
                        and producing the ticket), I will show an icon hinting
                        how many seats are available.

                <section class="project-info">
                    <h1>4. Payment</h1>

                    <p>
                        I chose to show the payment once the user selects the
                        seats. The price should be transparent and shown
                        upfront, so there won’t be any surprises.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I didn’t want to reinvent the checkout process, I
                        believe this problem can be best solved by Apple Pay or
                        Google Wallet. In the real app, there would need to be
                        more traditional choices for payment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I also chose to add illustrations of tickets, to make it
                        feel like the reward (the movie tickets) is just behind
                        this next button. This, I believe, would make the
                        process feel more rewarding.

                    <p>
                        I wanted to run a small experience to see if my solution
                        works well. So I used these screens and built a
                        prototype in InVision for the app. I shared it with 3
                        friends who’ve never seen the app. I told them to:
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Try to buy 2 tickets to ‘Blade Runner 2049', today, to
                        the screening with the least seats taken.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Once you’re done, buy 2 tickets to any movie today in
                        the evening.

                        They were successful doing that, but it still doesn’t
                        mean much :) It only means that it’s not too
                        complicated. This is an MVP tested on very few people,
                        and in the real world there are many more things to
                        consider and monitor.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        If Cinema companies had more awareness to user
                        experience, I’m sure more people would want to go to the
                        cinemas. Maybe with this change, next time a new cool
                        indie movie comes out, I might actually find someone
                        who’d like to join me.
